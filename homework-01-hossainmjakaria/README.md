# CS569 Homework

### 1. Write a summary with TypeScript code examples of the Singleton pattern.
Singleton pattern is Creational pattern which has following characteristics -

- Singleton pattern ensures only one instance of a class.
- Made by private constructor and static method.
- Used for resource sharing, global access, etc.

### 2. What advantage do we get from using the Decorator pattern?
Advantage:
- Add or change behavior of objects dynamically.
- Used to add logging, caching, security, etc.

### 3. Write TypeScipt code using RxJS to convert an array of objects from `[{first: string, last: string }]` to `[{fullname: string}]`.
Use the `from` operator to create the observable, in addition to `map` and `toArray` operators.
